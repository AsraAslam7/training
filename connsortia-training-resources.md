# Training resources from AIM consortia

This document contains information about available training on relevant topics that members of the AIM consortia are aware of and can recommend.
These can be workshops and courses offered by the institutions with which they are affiliated or open courses freely available online, e.g. on Coursera or edX.
This list does not intend to be comprehensive; rather it should point to relevant courses that, ideally, the consortia members have participated in and benefited from.

## Open research and reproducibility
- [The Turing Way Guide for Reproducible Research]([https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html) is a lightly opinionated guide on making your research reproducible. It covers topics such as version control, testing, and computational environemnts. The Turing Way is free to use and reuse and is also a lovely community that welcomes new contributions âœ¨


## Data science
- The [Research Software Engineering with Python course](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rse-course/html/index.html) from the Research Engineering group at the Alan Turing Institute teaches researchers how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment. The course requires (online) attendance for half a day every day for two weeks from 31 October to 11 November 2022. 
    - Attendance is free but you need to [apply](https://www.eventsforce.net/turingevents/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=72112&eventID=210&traceRedir=2). Applications for this round close on 12 October.
- [Turing Commons](https://turing-commons.netlify.app/) is an online platform to support open dialogue and reflection about the responsible design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. The courses on it are free and self-paced; you can follow them any time!
    -  [Responsible reseach and innovation](https://turing-commons.netlify.app/rri/)
    -  [Public engagement of data science and AI](https://turing-commons.netlify.app/ped/)

## Working with biomedical data
- Courses and events from the [Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-research-facility/core-services/education/courses-events), covering topics such as understanding how to access UK health data for research and submitting NHS Research Ethics applications.
    - There is a fee for these courses (usually 40 - 90 GBP for non-UoE students/researchers) but some [Open Educational Resources](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-research-facility/core-services/education/oer) are also available.

## Communication and collaboration
- [The Turing Way Guide for Communication](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/communication.html) covers topics related to effective communication in research, with chapters on traditional modes of academic writing (e.g. papers, posters, peer review), but also social media, blogs, and podcasts for research.
- [The Turing Way Guide for Collaboration](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/collaboration.html) covers topics related to effective and inclusive collaboration, with chapters on using GitHub for collaboration, managing a new team, and remote collaboration.

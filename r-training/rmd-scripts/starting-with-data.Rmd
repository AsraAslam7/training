# Data frames

**Data frames** are the standard data structure for tabular data in `R`. 
--
They look very similar to spreadsheets (like in Excel) but each column is, in fact, a vector.
Each vector needs to be of the same length, for a perfectly rectangular shape `r emo::ji("square")` `r emo::ji("square")` `r emo::ji("square")`.

--

Note that because the columns are all vectors, they must all be of the *same type*.

--

## A note on terminology

Technically, what we will be working with in these workshops aren't `data.frames`, they are `tibbles`.
`tibbles` are basically data frames for the `tidyverse` - they have some subtle differences but nothing you need to be aware of at this point.

# Tabular data: What is tidy data?

# Tabular data: File formats

--

.pull-left[

### Comma delimited

comma-separated value files (.csv) are plain text files where the columns are separated by commas

`r emo::ji("thumbs_up_medium_light_skin_tone")` commonly used

`r emo::ji("thumbs_down_medium_light_skin_tone")` annoying when data itself contains commas

]

--

.pull-right[

### Tab delimited

tab-separated value files (.tsv) are plain text files where the columns are separated by tabs (\t)


`r emo::ji("thumbs_up_medium_light_skin_tone")` no confusion when data contains commas or semicolons

`r emo::ji("thumbs_down_medium_light_skin_tone")` not very commonly used (at least not yet)

# The data

The data is historic data of worldwide COVID-19 positive cases and deaths.
The data was made available by the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.

They cover the period from 1 January 2020 to 20 June 2022.

# The data: variables

| variable | description |
|----------|-------------|
| country  | which country the data come from |
| country_code | a three-letter code for the country the data come from |
| continent | the continent in which the reporting country is located |
| population | the population of the reporting country according to Eurostat for Europe and the World Bank for the rest of the world |
| indicator | whether the observation is a positive case or a death |
| weekly_count | the number of positive cases or deaths in the week of reporting |
| year_week | the year and week when the observations occurred |
| rate_14_day | the rate of positive cases or deaths in the preceding 14 days |
| cumulative_count | the total number of cases or deaths from the start of data collection |
| source | what data source the data come from |

# Importing data: Folders

1. Double click on the R Project you created for the workshop to open RStudio.
2. Check that the files you see in your `Files` tab are the right ones (you should only see the `scripts` folder and the `.Rproj` file)
3. Go to the console and type the following commands



```{r create-directory, eval=FALSE}
# create separate folders for the raw and clean data
dir.create("data_raw")
dir.create("data_clean")

# only if you don't have one already, create a folder for the scripts
dir.create("scripts")
```

# Importing data: Download

Then we need to 1) download the data from the ECDC website and 2) save it in the `data_raw` folder we just created it.

We can do both in one go in R by typing the following command in the console:

```{r download-data, eval=FALSE}
# download the data
download.file(url = "https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/nationalcasedeath_archive/csv/data.csv",
              destfile = "data_raw/covid-data.csv")
```

After you have run this command, open the `data_raw` folder and check that there is a file called `covid-data.csv`.

# Exercise 1

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Create a tibble containing only the last 250 observations of `covid_data` (all the columns but only the last 250 rows).


Hint: you can get the number of rows in a dataset with `nrow`, e.g. `number_rows <- nrow(covid_data)`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

# Exercise 1 solution

There are multiple ways to solve this exercise.

#### Solution 1

```{r e1-s1} 
e1_s1_data_end <- nrow(covid_data)
e1_s1_data_start <- e1_s1_data_end - 249

e1_s1_data <- covid_data[e1_s1_data_start:e1_s1_data_end, ]
```

--

#### Solution 2

```{r e1-s2} 

e1_s2_data <- tail(covid_data, n = 250)
```

# Exercise 2

`r emo::ji("clock")` **3 mins**

Calculate the minimum and maximum values for the countries' populations.

Hint: the functions you need here are `min` and `max`.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Exercise 2 solution

```{r e2}
country_populations <- covid_data$population

min_population_ <- min(country_populations)
max_population <- max(country_populations)
```

---

# Factors

R has a special data class, called **factor**, to deal with *categorical data*.
Factors are very useful and contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data.

--

Factors are stored as **integers** associated with labels. 
--
They can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). 
--
Factors create a structured relation between the different levels (values) of a categorical variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in a survey. 
--
Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as **levels**.

--

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. **So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.**

---

# Dates

To avoid ambiguity, use the [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) standard: **YYYYMMDD** (or YYYY-MM-DD).

```{r date-formats, echo = FALSE, out.height="70%", out.width ="70%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(here("rmd-scripts", "images", "date-formats.png"))
```

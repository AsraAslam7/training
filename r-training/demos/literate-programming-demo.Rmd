## Code

```{r}
countries <- c("United Kingdom", "Greece", "Netherlands")
population_m <- c(68, 11, 17)
```

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r read-data}
covid_data <- read_tsv(here("data_clean", "covid_data_clean.tsv"))
```

```{r table}
covid_data %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries,
         year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(deaths_per_year = sum(deaths_count)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Country", "Deaths per year"),
               caption = "COVID deaths per country for selected countries in 2020")

```

```{r deaths-per-year}
deaths_per_year <- covid_data %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries,
         year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(deaths_per_year = sum(deaths_count))

deaths_per_year$deaths_per_year[1]

```

There were `r deaths_per_year$deaths_per_year[1]` COVID deaths in Greece in 2020.


```{r deaths-per-year-plot, fig.height=6, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Plot showing total deaths in selected countries in 2020", include=FALSE}
covid_data %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries,
         year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(deaths_per_year = sum(deaths_count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country),
         country = reorder(country, deaths_per_year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = deaths_per_year)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

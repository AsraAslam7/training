# Today's session

- Short recap of last session (**version control**, **git**, **GitHub**, **repositories**, **commits**, **organisations**)
- Working collaboratively on **branches**, **creating pull requests** and **merging**
- Practise the collaborative workflow with exercises
- Using **issues** to suggest changes
- Practise fixing issues using the collaborative workflow
- Resources
- End/ Optional additional practice

---

# Recap: Version control

.center[

Version control is the practice of keeping track of changes in files and it helps you document your work and collaborate. Version control allows you to save the timeline of a file and move to past versions.

# Recap: Git and GitHub

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="images/Git-Logo-White.png" width="90%" height="90%" /&gt;

- Git is one of the most widely used version control systems
- You can use it locally on your machine through the command line or a GUI
- Git takes snapshots of your projects at various timepoints, called commits
]


.pull-right[

.center[

&lt;img src="images/GitHub-Mark-Light-120px-plus.png" width="40%" height="40%" /&gt;
]

- GitHub is a website that hosts and helps you share projects tracked with git
- It can also be used for project management, though we won't cover that today

]

# Branches

Up until now we've been assuming a linear workflow, something like this:

.center[
&lt;img src="images/LinearDevelopment.png" width="75%" height="75%" /&gt;
]

A lot of the time we need a temporary space to work on features in parallel, without affecting the main timeline. Two reasons:
- **experimentation**: you can try things out without breaking whatever it is you are developing
- **collaboration**: others can review your work while it's developed and give you feedback

A branch points to a specific commit in your repository.

---

&lt;img src="images/github-branch.png" width="90%" height="90%" /&gt;

Above, you can see the branches of the `Getting Started` repository:
- the black line is `main`
- the first blue and green lines are branches that were integrated into main
- the second blue and green lines are branches that are still being developed

---

# Pull requests

After finishing working on a feature, you'll want to incorporate it back into the main branch.

You do this by submitting a **pull request**, in which you explain what the proposed changes are and what they do.

You should then ask for a **reviewer** who will evaluate your proposed changes.

---

# Merge

The reviewer will look at the proposed changes and either accept them as they are or ask for changes. After the pull request has been accepted, it can be **merged**, i.e., the changes can be incorporated into the main branch.

You should generally not accept your own pull requests.

---

# Branches and forks

You can only create branches in repositories where you have been invited as a collaborator and been given **write access**.

If you want to contribute to a repository in which you are not a collaborator, you cannot create a branch; you must create a **fork**. When you fork a repository, you create a copy of that repository within your personal account.

---

# Working with branches (or forks)

The workflow is as follows:
1. If you are a collaborator in the repository, create a branch, giving it an informative name. If you are not a collaborator in the repository, fork it into your account.
2. Work on whatever it is you are developing, committing regularly
3. When you are happy with your work, submit a **pull request** explaining what it is you have done and ask for someone to review it
4. Once the changes have been reviewed and accepted, **merge** into the main branch

---

# Using GitHub: Making commits in branches

1. Go to the .white[[intros.md](https://github.com/aim-rsf/github-intro/blob/main/intros.md)] in the github-intro repository
2. Click on the pencil to edit
3. Add your name next to the same number as in the HackMD
4. Click on commit
5. Add a commit message
6. Select the option to commit in a new branch
7. Give an informative name to your branch (e.g. your name)
8. Click on the commit button
9. Leave the messages as they are and submit the pull request
10. Assign me (@eirini-zormpa) or Sophia (@BrainonSilicon) as a reviewer

# Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

# Issues

**Issues** are like posts on a repository. You can use them to flag things that should be changed: that can be bugs or errors that need to be fixed or new features that could be added to the repository to enhance it.

Issues have a title and a text box where you can add more details. Make your issues as detailed as you can, explaining what you think should happen and how it would improve the project.

If you want to contribute to a repository, checking the issues is a great way to get started! That way you can see what help is needed and you maximise the chances of your pull requests being merged!

---

# Issues vs. pull requests

- You use issues to propose new ideas for changes and discuss those ideas with other people working on the project. You do this before actually making any changes.
- You submit a pull request to propose the implementation of the changes that were discussed in the issue.

---

# Using GitHub: Working on issues

1. Navigate to the [Getting started repository](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Getting-Started) of the AIM RSF organisation
2. Comment on the issue about consortia blurbs, saying how you can contribute
3. Create a branch with the name of your consortium (by clicking on the button that says `main`)
4. Edit the consortium-intro.md file with information on what you're working on within your project

---

# Summary

- You create a **branch** to develop something independently from main, if you are a collaborator in the repository
- You create a **fork** if you are not a collaborator in the repository.
- You submit a **pull request** when you've finished working on your changes
- If your pull request is approved, your changes will be **merged** into the main branch
- You can use **issues** to flag bugs and errors or new features that the project would benefit from

Git and GitHub have **a lot of weird terms** but you do get used to it!

# Optional exercise: create a README about yourself!

1. Create a new repository by clicking the "+" on the banner and selecting "New repository"
2. Give a name to your repository that is EXACTLY THE SAME as your GitHub username (in my case eirini-zormpa)
3. Make sure the repository is public
4. Initialise it with a README
5. Click on "Create repository"
6. Edit the README template that you see according to your background and interests
7. Commit your changes

# Recap: Version control

.center[
```{r verions-control, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%"}
include_graphics(here("images", "LinearDevelopment.png"))
```
]

Version control is the practice of keeping track of changes in files and it helps you document your work and collaborate. Version control allows you to save the timeline of a file and move to past versions.

# Recap: Git and GitHub

.pull-left[

```{r git, echo = FALSE, out.height="90%", out.width="90%"}
include_graphics(here("images", "Git-Logo-White.png"))
```

- Git is one of the most widely used version control systems
- You can use it locally on your machine through the command line or a GUI
- Git takes snapshots of your projects at various timepoints, called commits
]


.pull-right[

.center[

```{r github, echo = FALSE, out.height="40%", out.width="40%"}
include_graphics(here("images", "GitHub-Mark-Light-120px-plus.png"))
```
]

- GitHub is a website that hosts and helps you share projects tracked with git
- It can also be used for project management, though we won't cover that today

# Branches

Up until now we've been assuming a linear workflow, something like this:

.center[
```{r linear-development, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%"}
include_graphics(here("images", "LinearDevelopment.png"))
```
]

A lot of the time we need a temporary space to work on features in parallel, without affecting the main timeline, but is developed in parallel. Two reasons:
- **experimentation**: you can try things out without breaking whatever it is you are developing
- **collaboration**: others can review your work while it's developed and give you feedback

A branch points to a specific commit in your repository.

---

# Pull requests

After finishing working on a feature, you'll want to incorporate it back into the main branch.

You do this by submitting a **pull request**, in which you explain what the proposed changes are and what they do.

You should then ask for a **reviewer** who will evaluate your proposed changes.

---

# Merge

The reviewer will look at the proposed changes and either accept them as they are or ask for changes. After the pull request has been accepted, it can be **merged**, i.e., the changes can be incorporated into the main branch.

You should generally not accept your own pull requests.

---

```{r github-branch, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", out.height="90%"}
include_graphics(here("images", "github-branch.png"))
```

Above, you can see the branches of the `Getting Started` repository:
- the black line is `main`
- the first blue and green lines are branches that were merged in
- the second blue and green lines are branches that are still being developed

---

# Working with branches

The workflow is as follows:
1. Create a branch, giving it an informative name
2. Work on whatever it is you are developing, committing regularly
3. When you are happy with your work, submit a **pull request** explaining what it is you have done and ask for someone to review it
4. Once the changes have been reviewed and accepted, **merge** into the main branch

# Using GitHub: Making commits in branches

1. Go to the file I just created
2. Click on the pencil to edit
3. Add your name
4. Click on commit
5. Add a commit message
6. Select the option to commit in a new branch
7. Give an informative name to your branch (e.g. your name)
8. Click on the commit button
9. Leave the messages as they are and submit the pull request
10. Assign me (eirini-zormpa) as a reviewer

# Congratulations! `r emo::ji("tada")`

# Summary

- You create a **branch** to develop something independently from main
- You submit a **pull request** when you've finished working on your changes
  - If your pull request is approved, your changes will be **merged** into the main branch

Git and GitHub have **a lot of weird terms** but you do get used to it!

# Optional exercise: create a README about yourself!

1. Create a new repository by clicking the "+" on the banner and selecting "New repository"
2. Give a name to your repository that is EXACTLY THE SAME as your GitHub username (in my case eirini-zormpa)
3. Make sure the repository is public
4. Initialise it with a README
5. Click on "Create repository"
6. Edit the README template that you see according to your background and interests
7. Commit your changes
